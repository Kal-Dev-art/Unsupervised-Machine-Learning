# Unsupervised-Machine-Learning:
In this challenge, I used my knowledge of Python and unsupervised machine learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Created a PCA model instance, and set n_components=3.

Used the PCA model to reduce the features to three principal components. 

Got the explained variance to determine how much information can be attributed to each principal component. 

Answered the following question: What's the total explained variance of the three principal components?

Created a new DataFrame from the scaled PCA data. Made sure to set the coin_id index from the original scaled DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame. Reviewed the first five rows of the DataFrame.
